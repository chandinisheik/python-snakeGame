Certainly! Here's the complete documentation for each function in your Snake game:

## Constants
+ WIDTH: Width of the game window.
+ HEIGHT: Height of the game window.
+ DELAY: The time delay (in milliseconds) for the game loop.
## offsets Dictionary
+ A dictionary that maps the directions ('up', 'down', 'left', 'right') to their respective coordinate offsets.
## Event Handlers
+ go_up(): Changes the snake_direction to 'up' if the current direction is not 'down'.
+ go_right(): Changes the snake_direction to 'right' if the current direction is not 'left'.
+ go_left(): Changes the snake_direction to 'left' if the current direction is not 'right'.
+ go_down(): Changes the snake_direction to 'down' if the current direction is not 'up'.
## game_loop() Function
+ The main game loop that handles the movement of the snake and checks for collisions.
+ Clears existing stamps made by the turtle.
+ Calculates the new head position based on the current direction and updates the snake's body.
+ Checks for collisions with the walls or itself, and terminates the game if a collision is detected.
+ Draws the updated snake on the screen.
+ Updates the screen and schedules the next iteration of the game loop using turtle.ontimer().
## Turtle Setup
+ Creates a turtle screen with dimensions specified by WIDTH and HEIGHT.
+ Sets the title of the window to 'Snake' and the background color to pink.
+ Turns off automatic animation with screen.tracer(0).
## Event Binding
+ Listens for keyboard input events and binds them to the corresponding event handler functions.
## Turtle Stamp Setup
+ Creates a turtle (stamper) to handle the stamping of the snake segments.
+ Sets the shape of the turtle to 'square' and lifts the pen (penup) to avoid drawing lines.
## Initial Snake Setup
+ Initializes the snake as a list of coordinate pairs.
+ Sets the initial direction of the snake to 'up'.
+ Draws the initial snake on the screen.
## Game Initialization
+ Calls the game_loop() function to start the game loop.
## Termination
+ The game stops when a collision is detected, and the window is closed with turtle.bye().
## Turtle Cleanup
+ Calls turtle.done() to properly close the turtle graphics window.
